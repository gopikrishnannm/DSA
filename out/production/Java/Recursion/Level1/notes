linear recurrence relation - fibanocci - f(n-1)+f(n-2)
    give 50 as input - repeated function calls occurs - inefficient
Divide and conquer recurrence - binary search - O(1) [for comparison] + f(n/2) [for dividing]
----------------------------------------------------------------
variables in recursion
    example - binary search
    start and end should be passed to next function call in order to reduces the size of the array by half
    in order to find middle element we have m = s + (e-s)/2 which is required only for this function call
    ie. doesn't have any effect on next call because we will change start/end to mid+1/mid-1

    function call can be
    search(int[] arr, int target, int s, int e)


    make sure to return a result of a function call of the return type
